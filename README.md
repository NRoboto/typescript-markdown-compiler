# Typescript Markdown Compiler

A markdown compiler written in typescript with a very simple react frontend.

This compiler shouldn't be used for production purposes as it is only intended as an example, instead use a library such as [markedjs](https://github.com/markedjs/marked).

***Note*: This is still a work in progress, currently the compiler only contains a lexical and syntactic analyser.**
